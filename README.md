Built to understand blockchain abstract data structure


Basic blockchain text saving system


<p>This was going to be an experimentation to create a system for casting votes and storing them in a Blockchain each block would then contain 10 votes.
The chains would be set up in each region allowing for a distributed network.
This will be rebuilt in Rust, but I believe it is not really a good idea as hacking attempts can still occur.
